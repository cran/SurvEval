Description: Provides predictive accuracy tools to evaluate time-to-event survival models. This includes calculating the concordance probability estimate that incorporates the follow-up time for a particular study developed by Devlin, Gonen, Heller (2020)<doi:10.1007/s10985-020-09503-3>. It also evaluates the concordance probability estimate for nested Cox proportional hazards models using a projection-based approach by Heller and Devlin (under review).
